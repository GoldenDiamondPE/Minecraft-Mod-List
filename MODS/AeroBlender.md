AeroBlender is a library mod dependent on TerraBlender, with the intent to add terrablender's functionality to The Aether Dimension.  
This API allows modders to add biomes in a simple and compatible manner with Aether's biome/terrain system.  
It is mainly used in Deep Aether and other Aether addons.
