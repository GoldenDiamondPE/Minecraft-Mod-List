This mod is designed to fix various memory leaks from mods, Minecraft and (Neo)Forge.

Many players suffer from playing their modded modpacks and eventually needing to close the game or crash after some time. This is a classic symptom of memory leak.

Our goal is to make it as much stable as possible.
