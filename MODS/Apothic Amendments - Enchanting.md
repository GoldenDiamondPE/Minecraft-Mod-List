Ever wish you could decorate your Apotheosis Enchanting setup without _completely_ destroying your enchanting stats?

This mod applies reasonable Apotheosis Enchanting stats to select Amendments items (formerly covered by Supplementaries & Apothic Supplementaries).  Currently included are:

- Skull Candles: Provides the same stats as the sum of a skull and 4 candles.
- Soul Skull Candles: Same as skull candles, but with a slight added bonus.
- Skull Piles: Provides the same stats of 2 skulls.
