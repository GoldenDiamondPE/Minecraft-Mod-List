🌟 Initially a remake of Pmmo Bridge but now a general Ars Nouveau bridge with other mods. It currently integrates ways to use 🌀 **Pehkui & Identity** scaling and morph mechanics (along with abilities for ars mobs), combining them with Ars glyphs.

As bridge, there's a system to "level up" magic skills using **Pmmo & Scaling Health** scaling.

For magic content mods like Hexerei, Hexcasting and Malum, this addon adds little features to unify them with Ars Nouveau. 

Another tweak this mod adds is flagging most of the damage made by spells as magic, allowing interactions with Malum & Hexerei equipment that can boost or reduce magic damage. 🛡️

Also, it introduces Stairs - you know Latin, Scala -> Stairs.
