- **Insert**: Inserts nearby items into nearby containers in a medium radius where this spell is activated. The range may be expanded with AOE, and Split will distribute items evenly. Using item frames for filters, like with Starbuncles, is supported.

- **Telefeast**: Consumes the first edible/potion, or some amount of liquid, found in the container/tank this was cast on. Can be tweaked to work differently.

# Equipment/other

- **Runic Spanner**: An upgrade to the Wrench from Create. This will allow you to set the cooldown for Runes by right-clicking on them, as well as picking up turrets, pedestals and containment jars by shift-right-clicking.
- **Thread of Pressure**: Gives the same capabilities as wearing a (Create) back tank would. Refills air over time *** Spy Monocle**: A minified version of the Spyglass which can be worn on the Head curio slot. Uses the same hotkey as the Alchemist's Crown (G by default).
- **Focus of Transmutation**: which increases Luck, improves Whirl processing speed and doubles chance-based item outputs from Haunting and Washing
- **Source Motor**: Converts source to kinetic energy. You can set the RPM which scales with the source consumption - along with a SU-to-RPM ratio which also affects source consumption.
- **pocket_factory**: A music disc that can be found in simple dungeons.
- **New XP gems**: of size 48xp and 192xp
- **Liquid source heated mixing recipes**: only when starbunclemania is installed (optional)
