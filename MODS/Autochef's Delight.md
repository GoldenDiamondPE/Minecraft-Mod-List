In Farmer's Delight, there has long been a problem with not being able to place the same ingredients in the same slot of a cooking pot to make food. This makes it difficult to automate food. And this mod is made to solve this problem. ([original issue](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/issues/26))

Also slightly improved performance by extracting the same logic before recipe-matching.

**New in 1.21:** Improved performance by no longer unnecessarily matching recipes in inactive status.
