**What is this?**

Abstraction Layer (but not really)™ for Blay's multi-loader mods. This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own. 

This is also not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.
