With the theme of archeology being introduced in the Minecraft 1.20 "Trails & Tales" Update, it has quickly become clear that Mojang sadly only took a small step into the big world that is archeology.

It is our goal with this mod to improve upon the mechanics introduced in the update and expand the minecraft universe with new stuff to discover while staying true to the nature of the game.

We also plan to regularly update the mod to newer versions and provide new content in the weeks to follow.
