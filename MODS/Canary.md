Canary is a general performance optimization mod and unofficial fork of Lithium mod for Minecraft Forge. It works on both the client and server, and can be installed on servers without requiring clients to also have the mod.

Canary contains the original Lithium optimizations (mob AI, chunk loading, game physics, etc..) and also, Canary contains new optimizations to make the gameplay smoother, without changing any behavior.
