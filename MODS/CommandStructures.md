This utility mod for Neoforge, Forge, Quilt, and Fabric is great for any modder or datapacker that is looking to create custom jigsaw structures but wants a way to spawn the structures quickly or have all nbt pieces laid out neatly. It also provides a way to spawn configuredfeatures and placedfeatures to make debugging those easier.
