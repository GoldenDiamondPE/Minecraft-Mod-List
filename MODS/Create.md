Welcome to Create, a mod offering a variety of tools and blocks for Building, Decoration and Aesthetic Automation.

The added elements of tech are designed to leave as many design choices to the player as possible. With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.

Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you though all added mechanics and gadgets.

Important: In order to be able to see all recipes required in Create, consider installing JEI. The vanilla recipe book will not be able to guide you through the experience by itself.
