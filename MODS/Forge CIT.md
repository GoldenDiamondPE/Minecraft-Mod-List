MCPatcher had a feature called Custom Item Textures (or CIT for short) which was later adopted by Optifine.

Custom Item Textures allowed resourcepacks to replace the appearance of items when they met certain conditions.

Forge CIT does exactly that but as a standalone Fabric mod which does not require MCPatcher nor Optifine!
